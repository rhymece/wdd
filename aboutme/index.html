    <p>I am from Philippines but this year we migrated in Canada. Married, with two beautiful daughters. I am a convert of the Church of 
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was baptized eight years ago.</p>
    
    <p> I am working as a manufacturing technician in a pharmaceutical company as my first job here in Canada. Right now,
        I want to pursue my 2nd Degree in BYU in Software Development, I am excited to learn more about web development 
        and programming languages. I am taking this course for I get suddenly interested in coding when I learned how website are being built
        and how programmer design it. &#128513;
