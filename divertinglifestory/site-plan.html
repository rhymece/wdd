      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Most readers are always attracted to images rather than reading too much content that sometimes doesn't keep them scrolling your website. Once they get bored, they will just close the tab and find elsewhere with something more interesting. The big challenge right now for the front-end web developer is how to make your website stand out from the other websites and, if the readers are on your site, how you will make a good design for your website to keep them in your site. Not only in images readers are attracted to but also in the information they are looking for. The content presentation is also important to keep the reader occupied and on your website.</p>
      <p>
        It's my turn to create a website, and this will be my first. I was quite excited at first, but as the modules got deeper, it got harder and sometimes I couldn't follow the lessons anymore, especially in the CSS section.   
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the personal website that I will start to build is to know how much I learned in this course. From then I can decide on my career path if, I keep going or to venture into another course. Organizing the HTML code is tricky. It's not just you will write a simple HTML but you have to consider their groupings. Based on that grouping, will be easy to design with CSS, but in my case, still I can't fully understand them. CSS designing is fun but many things to consider, especially in "display" but I really want to learn how to make the website responsive to any device. The page I will build will consist of two pages, the ""Portfolio"" and the ""Contac me"" not including Home page. The home page will have information about me, like my skills both technical and soft skills. Having this both skills in the home page will make the content diversify to keep it interesting and keep the reader scroll to know more about the page. Every page will have more images than text to keep it interesting to read and will not be boring to scroll. There will be call to action design to link up to another two pages that don't need to go on top at the navigation bar just to go to the other page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Portfolio page, since this is my first website to build. Everything will be imaginary but of course, someday I will replace them with the real projects if get lucky. By this portfolio added in my page, I can showcase the achievements and projects I made that might have interest to employers or someone that is looking for a developer. Or maybe, for a start I can make my own website and hosted in the web and showcase it. This page is important that I should make more images in here with short description for better creative design. Images that can catch readers attention and for better understanding of every section of what I want to display. In this page also I will try to add few information about my educational attainment and past job experienced if applicable, to have a few information about myself. I will also if applicable to add my educational background, together with ratings maybe with my technical skills for better presentation and extra showing of skills. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Contact me" page will just be a page with information how to contact me. My social media platform will be there, email address and phone number. I will add a few images, too, and try to make the design better. I will try add too a contact form that reader can fill-up if they want to.
