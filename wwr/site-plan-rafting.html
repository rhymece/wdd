    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palette/ffcc70fffadd8ecddd22668d"
      target="_blank">https://colorhunt.co/palette/ffcc70fffadd8ecddd22668d</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">#22668D</td>
        <td class="secondary">#FFCC70</td>
        <td class="accent1">#8ECDDD</td>
        <td class="accent2"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: Montserrat
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Roboto
      <!-- change this -->
    </h4>
    <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
    <p>
      Specially thought to give the chance to young kids and people less at ease around water  to experience a gentler rafting trip. 
      In a safe but still extremely fun way, you'll ride class 1  and 2 waves while admiring bigger waves. 
      You might even be able to end the  experience with a swim in mellow currents. Nothing better for an initiation and 
      a great outdoor family day! 
    </p>
    <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
    <p class="colored">
      Are you eager for new experiences and you don't mind getting splashed by waves ? 
      The  adventurous excursion is perfect for you! After the last waves, you’ll have the opportunity go for a 
       swim while you appreciate an incomparable view. A unique, safe  and unforgettable experience for all the adventurers of this world.
    </p>
