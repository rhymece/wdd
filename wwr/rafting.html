                    <h4>The family descent:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This descent has been specially designed to allow young children, and people less comfortable in the water to live the rafting experience at a lower intensity. Without compromising on fun and safety, you'll face class 1 and 2 waves. However, you will be able to admire the biggest waves of the Lachine Rapids! If your guide allows you and if you feel like it, you will have the option to end the experience with a short swim while letting yourself be lulled by small currents. 
                        Nothing better for an initiation and a great day with the family!

                        The Adventurer is the descent of choice! Brave the biggest waves of the Lachine Rapids, such as the Out√©couteos and the famous Big John. 
                        Throughout the activity, you will gradually pass through class 1 to 4 rapids. After the last wave, you'll have the option to jump into 
                        the water for an out-of-this-world swim with stunning views of downtown.
